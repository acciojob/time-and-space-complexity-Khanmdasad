	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, efficient: Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of its input size. It is an essential factor in determining the performance and scalability of a program, as inefficient algorithms can lead to slow execution times and unresponsive applications.</p>
